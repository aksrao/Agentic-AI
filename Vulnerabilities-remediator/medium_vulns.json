    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nkernel: be more careful about dup_mmap() failures and uprobe registering\n\nIf a memory allocation fails during dup_mmap(), the maple tree can be left\nin an unsafe state for other iterators besides the exit path.  All the\nlocks are dropped before the exit_mmap() call (in mm/mmap.c), but the\nincomplete mm_struct can be reached through (at least) the rmap finding\nthe vmas which have a pointer back to the mm_struct.\n\nUp to this point, there have been no issues with being able to find an\nmm_struct that was only partially initialised.  Syzbot was able to make\nthe incomplete mm_struct fail with recent forking changes, so it has been\nproven unsafe to use the mm_struct that hasn't been initialised, as\nreferenced in the link below.\n\nAlthough 8ac662f5da19f (\"fork: avoid inappropriate uprobe access to\ninvalid mm\") fixed the uprobe access, it does not completely remove the\nrace.\n\nThis patch sets the MMF_OOM_SKIP to avoid the iteration of the vmas on the\noom side (even though this is extremely unlikely to be selected as an oom\nvictim in the race window), and sets MMF_UNSTABLE to avoid other potential\nusers from using a partially initialised mm_struct.\n\nWhen registering vmas for uprobe, skip the vmas in an mm that is marked\nunstable.  Modifying a vma in an unstable mm may cause issues if the mm\nisn't fully initialised.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nblock: fix queue freeze vs limits lock order in sysfs store methods\n\nqueue_attr_store() always freezes a device queue before calling the\nattribute store operation. For attributes that control queue limits, the\nstore operation will also lock the queue limits with a call to\nqueue_limits_start_update(). However, some drivers (e.g. SCSI sd) may\nneed to issue commands to a device to obtain limit values from the\nhardware with the queue limits locked. This creates a potential ABBA\ndeadlock situation if a user attempts to modify a limit (thus freezing\nthe device queue) while the device driver starts a revalidation of the\ndevice queue limits.\n\nAvoid such deadlock by not freezing the queue before calling the\n->store_limit() method in struct queue_sysfs_entry and instead use the\nqueue_limits_commit_update_frozen helper to freeze the queue after taking\nthe limits lock.\n\nThis also removes taking the sysfs lock for the store_limit method as\nit doesn't protect anything here, but creates even more nesting.\nHopefully it will go away from the actual sysfs methods entirely soon.\n\n(commit log adapted from a similar patch from  Damien Le Moal)",

Then, rtnl_unlock() by Thread B will release RTNL\nand wait for netdev_put() by Thread A.\n\nThread A, however, must hold RTNL after the unlock in dev_ifsioc(),\nwhich may take long under RTNL pressure, resulting in the splat by\nThread B.\n\n  Thread A (SIOCBRDELIF)           Thread B (SIOCBRDELBR)\n  ----------------------           ----------------------\n  sock_ioctl                       sock_ioctl\n  `- sock_do_ioctl                 `- br_ioctl_call\n     `- dev_ioctl                     `- br_ioctl_stub\n        |- rtnl_lock                     |\n        |- dev_ifsioc                    '\n        '  |- dev = __dev_get_by_name(...)\n           |- netdev_hold(dev, ...)      .\n       /   |- rtnl_unlock  ------.       |\n       |   |- br_ioctl_call       `--->  |- rtnl_lock\n  Race |   |  `- br_ioctl_stub           |- br_del_bridge\n  Window   |     |                       |  |- dev = __dev_get_by_name(...)\n       |   |     |  May take long        |  `- br_dev_delete(dev, ...)\n       |   |     |  under RTNL pressure  |     `- unregister_netdevice_queue(dev, ...)\n       |   |     |               |       `- rtnl_unlock\n       \\   |     |- rtnl_lock  <-'          `- netdev_run_todo\n           |     |- ...                        `- netdev_run_todo\n           |     `- rtnl_unlock                   |- __rtnl_unlock\n           |                                      |- netdev_wait_allrefs_any\n           |- netdev_put(dev, ...)  <----------------'\n                                                Wait refcnt decrement\n                                                and log splat below\n\nTo avoid blocking SIOCBRDELBR unnecessarily, let's not call\ndev_ioctl() for SIOCBRADDIF and SIOCBRDELIF.\n\nIn the dev_ioctl() path, we do the following:\n\n  1. Copy struct ifreq by get_user_ifreq in sock_do_ioctl()\n  2. Check CAP_NET_ADMIN in dev_ioctl()\n  3. Call dev_load() in dev_ioctl()\n  4. Fetch the master dev from ifr.ifr_name in dev_ifsioc()\n\n3. can be done by request_module() in br_ioctl_call(), so we move\n1., 2., and 4. to br_ioctl_stub().\n\nNote that 2. is also checked later in add_del_if(), but it's better\nperformed before RTNL.\n\nSIOCBRADDIF and SIOCBRDELIF have been processed in dev_ioctl() since\nthe pre-git era, and there seems to be no specific reason to process\nthem there.\n\n[0]:\nunregister_netdevice: waiting for wpan3 to become free.

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: ath12k: Avoid memory leak while enabling statistics\n\nDriver uses monitor destination rings for extended statistics mode and\nstandalone monitor mode. In extended statistics mode, TLVs are parsed from\nthe buffer received from the monitor destination ring and assigned to the\nppdu_info structure to update per-packet statistics. In standalone monitor\nmode, along with per-packet statistics, the packet data (payload) is\ncaptured, and the driver updates per MSDU to mac80211.\n\nWhen the AP interface is enabled, only extended statistics mode is\nactivated. As part of enabling monitor rings for collecting statistics,\nthe driver subscribes to HAL_RX_MPDU_START TLV in the filter\nconfiguration. This TLV is received from the monitor destination ring, and\nkzalloc for the mon_mpdu object occurs, which is not freed, leading to a\nmemory leak. The kzalloc for the mon_mpdu object is only required while\nenabling the standalone monitor interface. This causes a memory leak while\nenabling extended statistics mode in the driver.\n\nFix this memory leak by removing the kzalloc for the mon_mpdu object in\nthe HAL_RX_MPDU_START TLV handling. Additionally, remove the standalone\nmonitor mode handlings in the HAL_MON_BUF_ADDR and HAL_RX_MSDU_END TLVs.\nThese TLV tags will be handled properly when enabling standalone monitor\nmode in the future.\n\nTested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.3.1-00173-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1\nTested-on: WCN7850 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HMT.1.0.c5-00481-QCAHMTSWPL_V1.0_V2.0_SILICONZ-3",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndm: limit swapping tables for devices with zone write plugs\n\ndm_revalidate_zones() only allowed new or previously unzoned devices to\ncall blk_revalidate_disk_zones(). If the device was already zoned,\ndisk->nr_zones would always equal md->nr_zones, so dm_revalidate_zones()\nreturned without doing any work. This would make the zoned settings for\nthe device not match the new table. If the device had zone write plug\nresources, it could run into errors like bdev_zone_is_seq() reading\ninvalid memory because disk->conv_zones_bitmap was the wrong size.\n\nIf the device doesn't have any zone write plug resources, calling\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() will always correctly update device.  If\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() fails, it can still overwrite or clear the\ncurrent disk->nr_zones value. In this case, DM must restore the previous\nvalue of disk->nr_zones, so that the zoned settings will continue to\nmatch the previous value that it fell back to.\n\nIf the device already has zone write plug resources,\nblk_revalidate_disk_zones() will not correctly update them, if it is\ncalled for arbitrary zoned device changes.  Since there is not much need\nfor this ability, the easiest solution is to disallow any table reloads\nthat change the zoned settings, for devices that already have zone plug\nresources.  Specifically, if a device already has zone plug resources\nallocated, it can only switch to another zoned table that also emulates\nzone append.  Also, it cannot change the device size or the zone size. A\ndevice can switch to an error target.",

This\nbug manifests quite rarely under normal circumstances, but is\ntriggereable from a syz-program.",

Since the addr range [addr1 + 4096,\naddr1 + 8192] still maps the file, it will take vma_merge_new_range to\nexpand the range, and then do uprobe_mmap in vma_complete.  Since the\nmerged vma pgoff is also zero offset, it will install uprobe anon page to\nthe merged vma.  However, the upcomming move_page_tables step, which use\nset_pte_at to remap the vma2 uprobe pte to the merged vma, will overwrite\nthe newly uprobe pte in the merged vma, and lead that pte to be orphan.\n\nSince the uprobe pte will be remapped to the merged vma, we can remove the\nunnecessary uprobe_mmap upon merged vma.\n\nThis problem was first found in linux-6.6.y and also exists in the\ncommunity syzkaller:\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/all/000000000000ada39605a5e71711@google.com/T/",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsched/rt: Fix race in push_rt_task\n\nOverview\n========\nWhen a CPU chooses to call push_rt_task and picks a task to push to\nanother CPU's runqueue then it will call find_lock_lowest_rq method\nwhich would take a double lock on both CPUs' runqueues. If one of the\nlocks aren't readily available, it may lead to dropping the current\nrunqueue lock and reacquiring both the locks at once. During this window\nit is possible that the task is already migrated and is running on some\nother CPU. These cases are already handled. However, if the task is\nmigrated and has already been executed and another CPU is now trying to\nwake it up (ttwu) such that it is queued again on the runqeue\n(on_rq is 1) and also if the task was run by the same CPU, then the\ncurrent checks will pass even though the task was migrated out and is no\nlonger in the pushable tasks list.\n\nCrashes\n=======\nThis bug resulted in quite a few flavors of crashes triggering kernel\npanics with various crash signatures such as assert failures, page\nfaults, null pointer dereferences, and queue corruption errors all\ncoming from scheduler itself.\n\nSome of the crashes:\n-> kernel BUG at kernel/sched/rt.c:1616!

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: Fix backlog accounting in qdisc_dequeue_internal\n\nThis issue applies for the following qdiscs: hhf, fq, fq_codel, and\nfq_pie, and occurs in their change handlers when adjusting to the new\nlimit. The problem is the following in the values passed to the\nsubsequent qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog call given a tbf parent:\n\n   When the tbf parent runs out of tokens, skbs of these qdiscs will\n   be placed in gso_skb. Their peek handlers are qdisc_peek_dequeued,\n   which accounts for both qlen and backlog. However, in the case of\n   qdisc_dequeue_internal, ONLY qlen is accounted for when pulling\n   from gso_skb. This means that these qdiscs are missing a\n   qdisc_qstats_backlog_dec when dropping packets to satisfy the\n   new limit in their change handlers.\n\n   One can observe this issue with the following (with tc patched to\n   support a limit of 0):\n\n   export TARGET=fq\n   tc qdisc del dev lo root\n   tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1: tbf rate 8bit burst 100b latency 1ms\n   tc qdisc replace dev lo handle 3: parent 1:1 $TARGET limit 1000\n   echo ''; echo 'add child'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n   ping -I lo -f -c2 -s32 -W0.001 127.0.0.1 2>&1 >/dev/null\n   echo ''; echo 'after ping'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n   tc qdisc change dev lo handle 3: parent 1:1 $TARGET limit 0\n   echo ''; echo 'after limit drop'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n   tc qdisc replace dev lo handle 2: parent 1:1 sfq\n   echo ''; echo 'post graft'; tc -s -d qdisc show dev lo\n\n   The second to last show command shows 0 packets but a positive\n   number (74) of backlog bytes. The problem becomes clearer in the\n   last show command, where qdisc_purge_queue triggers\n   qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog with the positive backlog and causes an\n   underflow in the tbf parent's backlog (4096 Mb instead of 0).\n\nTo fix this issue, the codepath for all clients of qdisc_dequeue_internal\nhas been simplified: codel, pie, hhf, fq, fq_pie, and fq_codel.\nqdisc_dequeue_internal handles the backlog adjustments for all cases that\ndo not directly use the dequeue handler.\n\nThe old fq_codel_change limit adjustment loop accumulated the arguments to\nthe subsequent qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog call through the cstats field.\nHowever, this is confusing and error prone as fq_codel_dequeue could also\npotentially mutate this field (which qdisc_dequeue_internal calls in the\nnon gso_skb case), so we have unified the code here with other qdiscs.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmlx5: Fix default values in create CQ\n\nCurrently, CQs without a completion function are assigned the\nmlx5_add_cq_to_tasklet function by default. This is problematic since\nonly user CQs created through the mlx5_ib driver are intended to use\nthis function.\n\nAdditionally, all CQs that will use doorbells instead of polling for\ncompletions must call mlx5_cq_arm. However, the default CQ creation flow\nleaves a valid value in the CQ's arm_db field, allowing FW to send\ninterrupts to polling-only CQs in certain corner cases.\n\nThese two factors would allow a polling-only kernel CQ to be triggered\nby an EQ interrupt and call a completion function intended only for user\nCQs, causing a null pointer exception.\n\nSome areas in the driver have prevented this issue with one-off fixes\nbut did not address the root cause.\n\nThis patch fixes the described issue by adding defaults to the create CQ\nflow. It adds a default dummy completion function to protect against\nnull pointer exceptions, and it sets an invalid command sequence number\nby default in kernel CQs to prevent the FW from sending an interrupt to\nthe CQ until it is armed. User CQs are responsible for their own\ninitialization values.\n\nCallers of mlx5_core_create_cq are responsible for changing the\ncompletion function and arming the CQ per their needs.",

This routine initializes hardware blocks and\ntakes a few milliseconds to complete. During this time, the ICCQ draws a\nlarge current.\n\nThis large ICCQ current may cause issues for the regulator which is\nsupplying power to UFS, because the turn off request from UFS driver to\nthe regulator framework will be immediately followed by low power\nmode(LPM) request by regulator framework. This is done by framework\nbecause UFS which is the only client is requesting for disable. So if\nthe rail is still in the process of shutting down while ICCQ exceeds LPM\ncurrent thresholds, and LPM mode is activated in hardware during this\nstate, it may trigger an overcurrent protection (OCP) fault in the\nregulator.\n\nTo prevent this, a 10ms delay is added after asserting HWRST. This\nallows the reset operation to complete while power rails remain active\nand in high-power mode.\n\nCurrently there is no way for Host to query whether the reset is\ncompleted or not and hence this the delay is based on experiments with\nQualcomm UFS controllers across multiple UFS vendors.",

The update_userdata() function iterates over the\nnt->userdata_group.cg_children list, and count_extradata_entries() also\niterates over this same list to count nodes.\n\nQuoting from Documentation/filesystems/configfs.rst:\n> A subsystem can navigate the cg_children list and the ci_parent pointer\n> to see the tree created by the subsystem.

For example, the list_for_each() loop\ncan reach a node that is being removed from the list by list_del_init()\nwhich sets the nodes' .next pointer to point to itself, so the loop will\nnever end (or reach the WARN_ON_ONCE in update_userdata() ).\n\nFix this by holding the configfs subsystem mutex (su_mutex) during all\noperations that iterate over cg_children.\nThis includes:\n- userdatum_value_store() which calls update_userdata() to iterate over\n  cg_children\n- All sysdata_*_enabled_store() functions which call\n  count_extradata_entries() to iterate over cg_children\n\nThe su_mutex must be acquired before dynamic_netconsole_mutex to avoid\npotential lock ordering issues, as configfs operations may already hold\nsu_mutex when calling into our code.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: fix racy bitfield write in btrfs_clear_space_info_full()\n\nFrom the memory-barriers.txt document regarding memory barrier ordering\nguarantees:\n\n (*) These guarantees do not apply to bitfields, because compilers often\n     generate code to modify these using non-atomic read-modify-write\n     sequences.  Do not attempt to use bitfields to synchronize parallel\n     algorithms.\n\n (*) Even in cases where bitfields are protected by locks, all fields\n     in a given bitfield must be protected by one lock.  If two fields\n     in a given bitfield are protected by different locks, the compiler's\n     non-atomic read-modify-write sequences can cause an update to one\n     field to corrupt the value of an adjacent field.\n\nbtrfs_space_info has a bitfield sharing an underlying word consisting of\nthe fields full, chunk_alloc, and flush:\n\nstruct btrfs_space_info {\n        struct btrfs_fs_info *     fs_info;              /*     0     8 */\n        struct btrfs_space_info *  parent;               /*     8     8 */\n        ...\n        int                        clamp;                /*   172     4 */\n        unsigned int               full:1;               /*   176: 0  4 */\n        unsigned int               chunk_alloc:1;        /*   176: 1  4 */\n        unsigned int               flush:1;              /*   176: 2  4 */\n        ...\n\nTherefore, to be safe from parallel read-modify-writes losing a write to\none of the bitfield members protected by a lock, all writes to all the\nbitfields must use the lock. They almost universally do, except for\nbtrfs_clear_space_info_full() which iterates over the space_infos and\nwrites out found->full = 0 without a lock.\n\nImagine that we have one thread completing a transaction in which we\nfinished deleting a block_group and are thus calling\nbtrfs_clear_space_info_full() while simultaneously the data reclaim\nticket infrastructure is running do_async_reclaim_data_space():\n\n          T1                                             T2\nbtrfs_commit_transaction\n  btrfs_clear_space_info_full\n  data_sinfo->full = 0\n  READ: full:0, chunk_alloc:0, flush:1\n                                              do_async_reclaim_data_space(data_sinfo)\n                                              spin_lock(&space_info->lock);\n                                              if(list_empty(tickets))\n                                                space_info->flush = 0;\n                                                READ: full: 0, chunk_alloc:0, flush:1\n                                                MOD/WRITE: full: 0, chunk_alloc:0, flush:0\n                                                spin_unlock(&space_info->lock);\n                                                return;\n  MOD/WRITE: full:0, chunk_alloc:0, flush:1\n\nand now data_sinfo->flush is 1 but the reclaim worker has exited. This\nbreaks the invariant that flush is 0 iff there is no work queued or\nrunning. Once this invariant is violated, future allocations that go\ninto __reserve_bytes() will add tickets to space_info->tickets but will\nsee space_info->flush is set to 1 and not queue the work. After this,\nthey will block forever on the resulting ticket, as it is now impossible\nto kick the worker again.\n\nI also confirmed by looking at the assembly of the affected kernel that\nit is doing RMW operations. For example, to set the flush (3rd) bit to 0,\nthe assembly is:\n  andb    $0xfb,0x60(%rbx)\nand similarly for setting the full (1st) bit to 0:\n  andb    $0xfe,-0x20(%rax)\n\nSo I think this is really a bug on practical systems.  I have observed\na number of systems in this exact state, but am currently unable to\nreproduce it.\n\nRather than leaving this footgun lying around for the future, take\nadvantage of the fact that there is room in the struct anyway, and that\nit is already quite large and simply change the three bitfield members to\nbools. This avoids writes to space_info->full having any effect on\n---truncated---",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: fix double free of qgroup record after failure to add delayed ref head\n\nIn the previous code it was possible to incur into a double kfree()\nscenario when calling add_delayed_ref_head(). This could happen if the\nrecord was reported to already exist in the\nbtrfs_qgroup_trace_extent_nolock() call, but then there was an error\nlater on add_delayed_ref_head(). In this case, since\nadd_delayed_ref_head() returned an error, the caller went to free the\nrecord. Since add_delayed_ref_head() couldn't set this kfree'd pointer\nto NULL, then kfree() would have acted on a non-NULL 'record' object\nwhich was pointing to memory already freed by the callee.\n\nThe problem comes from the fact that the responsibility to kfree the\nobject is on both the caller and the callee at the same time. Hence, the\nfix for this is to shift the ownership of the 'qrecord' object out of\nthe add_delayed_ref_head(). That is, we will never attempt to kfree()\nthe given object inside of this function, and will expect the caller to\nact on the 'qrecord' object on its own. The only exception where the\n'qrecord' object cannot be kfree'd is if it was inserted into the\ntracing logic, for which we already have the 'qrecord_inserted_ret'\nboolean to account for this. Hence, the caller has to kfree the object\nonly if add_delayed_ref_head() reports not to have inserted it on the\ntracing logic.\n\nAs a side-effect of the above, we must guarantee that\n'qrecord_inserted_ret' is properly initialized at the start of the\nfunction, not at the end, and then set when an actual insert\nhappens. This way we avoid 'qrecord_inserted_ret' having an invalid\nvalue on an early exit.\n\nThe documentation from the add_delayed_ref_head() has also been updated\nto reflect on the exact ownership of the 'qrecord' object.",

But the\netr_buf that is being used by the ETR remains pointed to buf_old, not\nupdated to buf_new. In this case, it will result in a memory\nuse-after-free issue.\n\nFix this by checking ETR's mode before updating and releasing buf_old,\nif the mode is CS_MODE_SYSFS, then skip updating and releasing it.",

GSO-related features are then rightfully disabled.\n\nWe get into this situation due to convert___skb_to_skb() setting\ngso_segs and gso_size but not gso_type. Technically, it makes sense\nthat this warning triggers since the GSO properties are malformed due\nto the gso_type. Potentially, the gso_type could be marked non-trustworthy\nthrough setting it at least to SKB_GSO_DODGY without any other specific\nassumptions, but that also feels wrong given we should not go further\ninto the GSO engine in the first place.\n\nThe checks were added in 121d57af308d (\"gso: validate gso_type in GSO\nhandlers\") because there were malicious (syzbot) senders that combine\na protocol with a non-matching gso_type. If we would want to drop such\npackets, gso_features_check() currently only returns feature flags via\nnetif_skb_features(), so one location for potentially dropping such skbs\ncould be validate_xmit_unreadable_skb(), but then otoh it would be\nan additional check in the fast-path for a very corner case. Given\nbpf_clone_redirect() is the only place where BPF test infra could emit\nsuch packets, lets reject them right there.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nlandlock: Fix handling of disconnected directories\n\nDisconnected files or directories can appear when they are visible and\nopened from a bind mount, but have been renamed or moved from the source\nof the bind mount in a way that makes them inaccessible from the mount\npoint (i.e. out of scope).\n\nPreviously, access rights tied to files or directories opened through a\ndisconnected directory were collected by walking the related hierarchy\ndown to the root of the filesystem, without taking into account the\nmount point because it couldn't be found. This could lead to\ninconsistent access results, potential access right widening, and\nhard-to-debug renames, especially since such paths cannot be printed.\n\nFor a sandboxed task to create a disconnected directory, it needs to\nhave write access (i.e. FS_MAKE_REG, FS_REMOVE_FILE, and FS_REFER) to\nthe underlying source of the bind mount, and read access to the related\nmount point.   Because a sandboxed task cannot acquire more access\nrights than those defined by its Landlock domain, this could lead to\ninconsistent access rights due to missing permissions that should be\ninherited from the mount point hierarchy, while inheriting permissions\nfrom the filesystem hierarchy hidden by this mount point instead.\n\nLandlock now handles files and directories opened from disconnected\ndirectories by taking into account the filesystem hierarchy when the\nmount point is not found in the hierarchy walk, and also always taking\ninto account the mount point from which these disconnected directories\nwere opened.  This ensures that a rename is not allowed if it would\nwiden access rights [1].\n\nThe rationale is that, even if disconnected hierarchies might not be\nvisible or accessible to a sandboxed task, relying on the collected\naccess rights from them improves the guarantee that access rights will\nnot be widened during a rename because of the access right comparison\nbetween the source and the destination (see LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER).\nIt may look like this would grant more access on disconnected files and\ndirectories, but the security policies are always enforced for all the\nevaluated hierarchies.  This new behavior should be less surprising to\nusers and safer from an access control perspective.\n\nRemove a wrong WARN_ON_ONCE() canary in collect_domain_accesses() and\nfix the related comment.\n\nBecause opened files have their access rights stored in the related file\nsecurity properties, there is no impact for disconnected or unlinked\nfiles.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: don't log conflicting inode if it's a dir moved in the current transaction\n\nWe can't log a conflicting inode if it's a directory and it was moved\nfrom one parent directory to another parent directory in the current\ntransaction, as this can result an attempt to have a directory with\ntwo hard links during log replay, one for the old parent directory and\nanother for the new parent directory.\n\nThe following scenario triggers that issue:\n\n1) We have directories \"dir1\" and \"dir2\" created in a past transaction.\n   Directory \"dir1\" has inode A as its parent directory;\n\n2) We move \"dir1\" to some other directory;\n\n3) We create a file with the name \"dir1\" in directory inode A;\n\n4) We fsync the new file. This results in logging the inode of the new file\n   and the inode for the directory \"dir1\" that was previously moved in the\n   current transaction. So the log tree has the INODE_REF item for the\n   new location of \"dir1\";\n\n5) We move the new file to some other directory. This results in updating\n   the log tree to included the new INODE_REF for the new location of the\n   file and removes the INODE_REF for the old location. This happens\n   during the rename when we call btrfs_log_new_name();\n\n6) We fsync the file, and that persists the log tree changes done in the\n   previous step (btrfs_log_new_name() only updates the log tree in\n   memory);\n\n7) We have a power failure;\n\n8) Next time the fs is mounted, log replay happens and when processing\n   the inode for directory \"dir1\" we find a new INODE_REF and add that\n   link, but we don't remove the old link of the inode since we have\n   not logged the old parent directory of the directory inode \"dir1\".\n\nAs a result after log replay finishes when we trigger writeback of the\nsubvolume tree's extent buffers, the tree check will detect that we have\na directory a hard link count of 2 and we get a mount failure.\nThe errors and stack traces reported in dmesg/syslog are like this:\n\n   [ 3845.729764] BTRFS info (device dm-0): start tree-log replay\n   [ 3845.730304] page: refcount:3 mapcount:0 mapping:000000005c8a3027 index:0x1d00 pfn:0x11510c\n   [ 3845.731236] memcg:ffff9264c02f4e00\n   [ 3845.731751] aops:btree_aops [btrfs] ino:1\n   [ 3845.732300] flags: 0x17fffc00000400a(uptodate|private|writeback|node=0|zone=2|lastcpupid=0x1ffff)\n   [ 3845.733346] raw: 017fffc00000400a 0000000000000000 dead000000000122 ffff9264d978aea8\n   [ 3845.734265] raw: 0000000000001d00 ffff92650e6d4738 00000003ffffffff ffff9264c02f4e00\n   [ 3845.735305] page dumped because: eb page dump\n   [ 3845.735981] BTRFS critical (device dm-0): corrupt leaf: root=5 block=30408704 slot=6 ino=257, invalid nlink: has 2 expect no more than 1 for dir\n   [ 3845.737786] BTRFS info (device dm-0): leaf 30408704 gen 10 total ptrs 17 free space 14881 owner 5\n   [ 3845.737789] BTRFS info (device dm-0): refs 4 lock_owner 0 current 30701\n   [ 3845.737792] \titem 0 key (256 INODE_ITEM 0) itemoff 16123 itemsize 160\n   [ 3845.737794] \t\tinode generation 3 transid 9 size 16 nbytes 16384\n   [ 3845.737795] \t\tblock group 0 mode 40755 links 1 uid 0 gid 0\n   [ 3845.737797] \t\trdev 0 sequence 2 flags 0x0\n   [ 3845.737798] \t\tatime 1764259517.0\n   [ 3845.737800] \t\tctime 1764259517.572889464\n   [ 3845.737801] \t\tmtime 1764259517.572889464\n   [ 3845.737802] \t\totime 1764259517.0\n   [ 3845.737803] \titem 1 key (256 INODE_REF 256) itemoff 16111 itemsize 12\n   [ 3845.737805] \t\tindex 0 name_len 2\n   [ 3845.737807] \titem 2 key (256 DIR_ITEM 2363071922) itemoff 16077 itemsize 34\n   [ 3845.737808] \t\tlocation key (257 1 0) type 2\n   [ 3845.737810] \t\ttransid 9 data_len 0 name_len 4\n   [ 3845.737811] \titem 3 key (256 DIR_ITEM 2676584006) itemoff 16043 itemsize 34\n   [ 3845.737813] \t\tlocation key (258 1 0) type 2\n   [ 3845.737814] \t\ttransid 9 data_len 0 name_len 4\n   [ 3845.737815] \titem 4 key (256 DIR_INDEX 2) itemoff 16009 itemsize 34\n   [ 3845.737816] \t\tlocation key (257 1 0) type 2\n   [\n---truncated---",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsched/deadline: only set free_cpus for online runqueues\n\nCommit 16b269436b72 (\"sched/deadline: Modify cpudl::free_cpus\nto reflect rd->online\") introduced the cpudl_set/clear_freecpu\nfunctions to allow the cpu_dl::free_cpus mask to be manipulated\nby the deadline scheduler class rq_on/offline callbacks so the\nmask would also reflect this state.\n\nCommit 9659e1eeee28 (\"sched/deadline: Remove cpu_active_mask\nfrom cpudl_find()\") removed the check of the cpu_active_mask to\nsave some processing on the premise that the cpudl::free_cpus\nmask already reflected the runqueue online state.\n\nUnfortunately, there are cases where it is possible for the\ncpudl_clear function to set the free_cpus bit for a CPU when the\ndeadline runqueue is offline. When this occurs while a CPU is\nconnected to the default root domain the flag may retain the bad\nstate after the CPU has been unplugged. Later, a different CPU\nthat is transitioning through the default root domain may push a\ndeadline task to the powered down CPU when cpudl_find sees its\nfree_cpus bit is set. If this happens the task will not have the\nopportunity to run.\n\nOne example is outlined here:\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250110233010.2339521-1-opendmb@gmail.com\n\nAnother occurs when the last deadline task is migrated from a\nCPU that has an offlined runqueue. The dequeue_task member of\nthe deadline scheduler class will eventually call cpudl_clear\nand set the free_cpus bit for the CPU.\n\nThis commit modifies the cpudl_clear function to be aware of the\nonline state of the deadline runqueue so that the free_cpus mask\ncan be updated appropriately.\n\nIt is no longer necessary to manage the mask outside of the\ncpudl_set/clear functions so the cpudl_set/clear_freecpu\nfunctions are removed. In addition, since the free_cpus mask is\nnow only updated under the cpudl lock the code was changed to\nuse the non-atomic __cpumask functions.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nethtool: Avoid overflowing userspace buffer on stats query\n\nThe ethtool -S command operates across three ioctl calls:\nETHTOOL_GSSET_INFO for the size, ETHTOOL_GSTRINGS for the names, and\nETHTOOL_GSTATS for the values.\n\nIf the number of stats changes between these calls (e.g., due to device\nreconfiguration), userspace's buffer allocation will be incorrect,\npotentially leading to buffer overflow.\n\nDrivers are generally expected to maintain stable stat counts, but some\ndrivers (e.g., mlx5, bnx2x, bna, ksz884x) use dynamic counters, making\nthis scenario possible.\n\nSome drivers try to handle this internally:\n- bnad_get_ethtool_stats() returns early in case stats.n_stats is not\n  equal to the driver's stats count.\n- micrel/ksz884x also makes sure not to write anything beyond\n  stats.n_stats and overflow the buffer.\n\nHowever, both use stats.n_stats which is already assigned with the value\nreturned from get_sset_count(), hence won't solve the issue described\nhere.\n\nChange ethtool_get_strings(), ethtool_get_stats(),\nethtool_get_phy_stats() to not return anything in case of a mismatch\nbetween userspace's size and get_sset_size(), to prevent buffer\noverflow.\nThe returned n_stats value will be equal to zero, to reflect that\nnothing has been returned.\n\nThis could result in one of two cases when using upstream ethtool,\ndepending on when the size change is detected:\n1. When detected in ethtool_get_strings():\n    # ethtool -S eth2\n    no stats available\n\n2. When detected in get stats, all stats will be reported as zero.\n\nBoth cases are presumably transient, and a subsequent ethtool call\nshould succeed.\n\nOther than the overflow avoidance, these two cases are very evident (no\noutput/cleared stats), which is arguably better than presenting\nincorrect/shifted stats.\nI also considered returning an error instead of a \"silent\" response, but\nthat seems more destructive towards userspace apps.\n\nNotes:\n- This patch does not claim to fix the inherent race, it only makes sure\n  that we do not overflow the userspace buffer, and makes for a more\n  predictable behavior.\n\n- RTNL lock is held during each ioctl, the race window exists between\n  the separate ioctl calls when the lock is released.\n\n- Userspace ethtool always fills stats.n_stats, but it is likely that\n  these stats ioctls are implemented in other userspace applications\n  which might not fill it. The added code checks that it's not zero,\n  to prevent any regressions.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipvs: fix ipv4 null-ptr-deref in route error path\n\nThe IPv4 code path in __ip_vs_get_out_rt() calls dst_link_failure()\nwithout ensuring skb->dev is set, leading to a NULL pointer dereference\nin fib_compute_spec_dst() when ipv4_link_failure() attempts to send\nICMP destination unreachable messages.\n\nThe issue emerged after commit ed0de45a1008 (\"ipv4: recompile ip options\nin ipv4_link_failure\") started calling __ip_options_compile() from\nipv4_link_failure(). This code path eventually calls fib_compute_spec_dst()\nwhich dereferences skb->dev. An attempt was made to fix the NULL skb->dev\ndereference in commit 0113d9c9d1cc (\"ipv4: fix null-deref in\nipv4_link_failure\"), but it only addressed the immediate dev_net(skb->dev)\ndereference by using a fallback device. The fix was incomplete because\nfib_compute_spec_dst() later in the call chain still accesses skb->dev\ndirectly, which remains NULL when IPVS calls dst_link_failure().\n\nThe crash occurs when:\n1. IPVS processes a packet in NAT mode with a misconfigured destination\n2. Route lookup fails in __ip_vs_get_out_rt() before establishing a route\n3. The error path calls dst_link_failure(skb) with skb->dev == NULL\n4. ipv4_link_failure() \u2192 ipv4_send_dest_unreach() \u2192\n   __ip_options_compile() \u2192 fib_compute_spec_dst()\n5. fib_compute_spec_dst() dereferences NULL skb->dev\n\nApply the same fix used for IPv6 in commit 326bf17ea5d4 (\"ipvs: fix\nipv6 route unreach panic\"): set skb->dev from skb_dst(skb)->dev before\ncalling dst_link_failure().\n\nKASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000328-0x000000000000032f]\nCPU: 1 PID: 12732 Comm: syz.1.3469 Not tainted 6.6.114 #2\nRIP: 0010:__in_dev_get_rcu include/linux/inetdevice.h:233\nRIP: 0010:fib_compute_spec_dst+0x17a/0x9f0 net/ipv4/fib_frontend.c:285\nCall Trace:\n  <TASK>\n  spec_dst_fill net/ipv4/ip_options.c:232\n  spec_dst_fill net/ipv4/ip_options.c:229\n  __ip_options_compile+0x13a1/0x17d0 net/ipv4/ip_options.c:330\n  ipv4_send_dest_unreach net/ipv4/route.c:1252\n  ipv4_link_failure+0x702/0xb80 net/ipv4/route.c:1265\n  dst_link_failure include/net/dst.h:437\n  __ip_vs_get_out_rt+0x15fd/0x19e0 net/netfilter/ipvs/ip_vs_xmit.c:412\n  ip_vs_nat_xmit+0x1d8/0xc80 net/netfilter/ipvs/ip_vs_xmit.c:764",

Since the folio is locked during\nreadahead, when reclaim evicts the fuse inode and fuse_evict_inode()\nattempts to remove all folios associated with the inode from the page\ncache (truncate_inode_pages_range()), reclaim will block forever waiting\nfor the lock since readahead cannot relinquish the lock because it is\nitself blocked in reclaim:\n\n>>> stack_trace(1504735)\n folio_wait_bit_common (mm/filemap.c:1308:4)\n folio_lock (./include/linux/pagemap.h:1052:3)\n truncate_inode_pages_range (mm/truncate.c:336:10)\n fuse_evict_inode (fs/fuse/inode.c:161:2)\n evict (fs/inode.c:704:3)\n dentry_unlink_inode (fs/dcache.c:412:3)\n __dentry_kill (fs/dcache.c:615:3)\n shrink_kill (fs/dcache.c:1060:12)\n shrink_dentry_list (fs/dcache.c:1087:3)\n prune_dcache_sb (fs/dcache.c:1168:2)\n super_cache_scan (fs/super.c:221:10)\n do_shrink_slab (mm/shrinker.c:435:9)\n shrink_slab (mm/shrinker.c:626:10)\n shrink_node (mm/vmscan.c:5951:2)\n shrink_zones (mm/vmscan.c:6195:3)\n do_try_to_free_pages (mm/vmscan.c:6257:3)\n do_swap_page (mm/memory.c:4136:11)\n handle_pte_fault (mm/memory.c:5562:10)\n handle_mm_fault (mm/memory.c:5870:9)\n do_user_addr_fault (arch/x86/mm/fault.c:1338:10)\n handle_page_fault (arch/x86/mm/fault.c:1481:3)\n exc_page_fault (arch/x86/mm/fault.c:1539:2)\n asm_exc_page_fault+0x22/0x27\n\nFix this deadlock by allocating ff->release_args and grabbing the\nreference on the inode when preparing the file for release even if the\nserver does not implement open.

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nInput: alps - fix use-after-free bugs caused by dev3_register_work\n\nThe dev3_register_work delayed work item is initialized within\nalps_reconnect() and scheduled upon receipt of the first bare\nPS/2 packet from an external PS/2 device connected to the ALPS\ntouchpad. During device detachment, the original implementation\ncalls flush_workqueue() in psmouse_disconnect() to ensure\ncompletion of dev3_register_work. However, the flush_workqueue()\nin psmouse_disconnect() only blocks and waits for work items that\nwere already queued to the workqueue prior to its invocation. Any\nwork items submitted after flush_workqueue() is called are not\nincluded in the set of tasks that the flush operation awaits.\nThis means that after flush_workqueue() has finished executing,\nthe dev3_register_work could still be scheduled. Although the\npsmouse state is set to PSMOUSE_CMD_MODE in psmouse_disconnect(),\nthe scheduling of dev3_register_work remains unaffected.\n\nThe race condition can occur as follows:\n\nCPU 0 (cleanup path)     | CPU 1 (delayed work)\npsmouse_disconnect()     |\n  psmouse_set_state()    |\n  flush_workqueue()      | alps_report_bare_ps2_packet()\n  alps_disconnect()      |   psmouse_queue_work()\n    kfree(priv); // FREE | alps_register_bare_ps2_mouse()\n                         |   priv = container_of(work...); // USE\n                         |   priv->dev3 // USE\n\nAdd disable_delayed_work_sync() in alps_disconnect() to ensure\nthat dev3_register_work is properly canceled and prevented from\nexecuting after the alps_data structure has been deallocated.\n\nThis bug is identified by static analysis.",

The process issues read I/O to ublk backend to read partition table\n3. In __ublk_complete_rq(), blk_update_request() or blk_mq_end_request()\n   runs bio->bi_end_io() callbacks\n4. If this triggers fput() on file descriptor of ublk block device, the\n   work may be deferred to current task's task work (see fput() implementation)\n5. This eventually calls blkdev_release() from the same context\n6. blkdev_release() tries to grab disk->open_mutex again\n7. Deadlock: same task waiting for a mutex it already holds\n\nThe fix is to run blk_update_request() and blk_mq_end_request() with bottom\nhalves disabled. This forces blkdev_release() to run in kernel work-queue\ncontext instead of current task work context, and allows ublk server to make\nforward progress, and avoids the deadlock.\n\n[axboe: rewrite comment in ublk]",

When RENAME_WHITEOUT\noperations are performed on such directories, f2fs_rename performs\ndirectory modifications (updating target entry and deleting source\nentry) before attempting to add the whiteout entry via f2fs_add_link.\n\nIf f2fs_add_link fails due to the corrupted directory structure, the\nfunction returns an error to VFS, but the partial directory\nmodifications have already been committed to disk. VFS assumes the\nentire rename operation failed and does not update the dentry cache,\nleaving stale mappings.\n\nIn the error path, VFS does not call d_move() to update the dentry\ncache. This results in new_dentry still pointing to the old inode\n(new_inode) which has already had its i_nlink decremented to zero.\nThe stale cache causes subsequent operations to incorrectly reference\nthe freed inode.\n\nThis causes subsequent operations to use cached dentry information that\nno longer matches the on-disk state. When a second rename targets the\nsame entry, VFS attempts to decrement i_nlink on the stale inode, which\nmay already have i_nlink=0, triggering a WARNING in drop_nlink().\n\nExample sequence:\n1. First rename (RENAME_WHITEOUT): file2 \u2192 file1\n   - f2fs updates file1 entry on disk (points to inode 8)\n   - f2fs deletes file2 entry on disk\n   - f2fs_add_link(whiteout) fails (corrupted directory)\n   - Returns error to VFS\n   - VFS does not call d_move() due to error\n   - VFS cache still has: file1 \u2192 inode 7 (stale!)\n   - inode 7 has i_nlink=0 (already decremented)\n\n2. Second rename: file3 \u2192 file1\n   - VFS uses stale cache: file1 \u2192 inode 7\n   - Tries to drop_nlink on inode 7 (i_nlink already 0)\n   - WARNING in drop_nlink()\n\nFix this by explicitly invalidating old_dentry and new_dentry when\nf2fs_add_link fails during whiteout creation. This forces VFS to\nrefresh from disk on subsequent operations, ensuring cache consistency\neven when the rename partially succeeds.\n\nReproducer:\n1. Mount F2FS image with corrupted i_current_depth\n2. renameat2(file2, file1, RENAME_WHITEOUT)\n3. renameat2(file3, file1, 0)\n4. System triggers WARNING in drop_nlink()",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npowerpc/64s/slb: Fix SLB multihit issue during SLB preload\n\nOn systems using the hash MMU, there is a software SLB preload cache that\nmirrors the entries loaded into the hardware SLB buffer. This preload\ncache is subject to periodic eviction \u2014 typically after every 256 context\nswitches \u2014 to remove old entry.\n\nTo optimize performance, the kernel skips switch_mmu_context() in\nswitch_mm_irqs_off() when the prev and next mm_struct are the same.\nHowever, on hash MMU systems, this can lead to inconsistencies between\nthe hardware SLB and the software preload cache.\n\nIf an SLB entry for a process is evicted from the software cache on one\nCPU, and the same process later runs on another CPU without executing\nswitch_mmu_context(), the hardware SLB may retain stale entries. If the\nkernel then attempts to reload that entry, it can trigger an SLB\nmulti-hit error.\n\nThe following timeline shows how stale SLB entries are created and can\ncause a multi-hit error when a process moves between CPUs without a\nMMU context switch.\n\nCPU 0                                   CPU 1\n-----                                    -----\nProcess P\nexec                                    swapper/1\n load_elf_binary\n  begin_new_exc\n    activate_mm\n     switch_mm_irqs_off\n      switch_mmu_context\n       switch_slb\n       /*\n        * This invalidates all\n        * the entries in the HW\n        * and setup the new HW\n        * SLB entries as per the\n        * preload cache.\n        */\ncontext_switch\nsched_migrate_task migrates process P to cpu-1\n\nProcess swapper/0                       context switch (to process P)\n(uses mm_struct of Process P)           switch_mm_irqs_off()\n                                         switch_slb\n                                           load_slb++\n                                            /*\n                                            * load_slb becomes 0 here\n                                            * and we evict an entry from\n                                            * the preload cache with\n                                            * preload_age().

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niommu: disable SVA when CONFIG_X86 is set\n\nPatch series \"Fix stale IOTLB entries for kernel address space\", v7.\n\nThis proposes a fix for a security vulnerability related to IOMMU Shared\nVirtual Addressing (SVA).  In an SVA context, an IOMMU can cache kernel\npage table entries.  When a kernel page table page is freed and\nreallocated for another purpose, the IOMMU might still hold stale,\nincorrect entries.  This can be exploited to cause a use-after-free or\nwrite-after-free condition, potentially leading to privilege escalation or\ndata corruption.\n\nThis solution introduces a deferred freeing mechanism for kernel page\ntable pages, which provides a safe window to notify the IOMMU to\ninvalidate its caches before the page is reused.\n\n\nThis patch (of 8):\n\nIn the IOMMU Shared Virtual Addressing (SVA) context, the IOMMU hardware\nshares and walks the CPU's page tables.  The x86 architecture maps the\nkernel's virtual address space into the upper portion of every process's\npage table.  Consequently, in an SVA context, the IOMMU hardware can walk\nand cache kernel page table entries.\n\nThe Linux kernel currently lacks a notification mechanism for kernel page\ntable changes, specifically when page table pages are freed and reused. \nThe IOMMU driver is only notified of changes to user virtual address\nmappings.  This can cause the IOMMU's internal caches to retain stale\nentries for kernel VA.\n\nUse-After-Free (UAF) and Write-After-Free (WAF) conditions arise when\nkernel page table pages are freed and later reallocated.  The IOMMU could\nmisinterpret the new data as valid page table entries.  The IOMMU might\nthen walk into attacker-controlled memory, leading to arbitrary physical\nmemory DMA access or privilege escalation.  This is also a\nWrite-After-Free issue, as the IOMMU will potentially continue to write\nAccessed and Dirty bits to the freed memory while attempting to walk the\nstale page tables.\n\nCurrently, SVA contexts are unprivileged and cannot access kernel\nmappings.  However, the IOMMU will still walk kernel-only page tables all\nthe way down to the leaf entries, where it realizes the mapping is for the\nkernel and errors out.  This means the IOMMU still caches these\nintermediate page table entries, making the described vulnerability a real\nconcern.\n\nDisable SVA on x86 architecture until the IOMMU can receive notification\nto flush the paging cache before freeing the CPU kernel page table pages.",

Here should be '__scs_magic(task_scs(tsk))'.\n\nThe user-visible effect of this bug is that when CONFIG_DEBUG_STACK_USAGE\nis enabled, the shadow call stack usage checking function\n(scs_check_usage) would scan an incorrect memory range.  This could lead\n\n1. **Inaccurate stack usage reporting**: The function would calculate\n   wrong usage statistics for the shadow call stack, potentially showing\n   incorrect value in kmsg.\n\n2. **Potential kernel crash**: If the value of __scs_magic(tsk)is\n   greater than that of __scs_magic(task_scs(tsk)), the for loop may\n   access unmapped memory, potentially causing a kernel panic.  However,\n   this scenario is unlikely because task_struct is allocated via the slab\n   allocator (which typically returns lower addresses), while the shadow\n   call stack returned by task_scs(tsk) is allocated via vmalloc(which\n   typically returns higher addresses).\n\nHowever, since this is purely a debugging feature\n(CONFIG_DEBUG_STACK_USAGE), normal production systems should be not\nunaffected.

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: x86: Fix VM hard lockup after prolonged inactivity with periodic HV timer\n\nWhen advancing the target expiration for the guest's APIC timer in periodic\nmode, set the expiration to \"now\" if the target expiration is in the past\n(similar to what is done in update_target_expiration()).  Blindly adding\nthe period to the previous target expiration can result in KVM generating\na practically unbounded number of hrtimer IRQs due to programming an\nexpired timer over and over.  In extreme scenarios, e.g. if userspace\npauses/suspends a VM for an extended duration, this can even cause hard\nlockups in the host.\n\nCurrently, the bug only affects Intel CPUs when using the hypervisor timer\n(HV timer), a.k.a. the VMX preemption timer.  Unlike the software timer,\na.k.a. hrtimer, which KVM keeps running even on exits to userspace, the\nHV timer only runs while the guest is active.  As a result, if the vCPU\ndoes not run for an extended duration, there will be a huge gap between\nthe target expiration and the current time the vCPU resumes running.\nBecause the target expiration is incremented by only one period on each\ntimer expiration, this leads to a series of timer expirations occurring\nrapidly after the vCPU/VM resumes.\n\nMore critically, when the vCPU first triggers a periodic HV timer\nexpiration after resuming, advancing the expiration by only one period\nwill result in a target expiration in the past.  As a result, the delta\nmay be calculated as a negative value.  When the delta is converted into\nan absolute value (tscdeadline is an unsigned u64), the resulting value\ncan overflow what the HV timer is capable of programming.  I.e. the large\nvalue will exceed the VMX Preemption Timer's maximum bit width of\ncpu_preemption_timer_multi + 32, and thus cause KVM to switch from the\nHV timer to the software timer (hrtimers).\n\nAfter switching to the software timer, periodic timer expiration callbacks\nmay be executed consecutively within a single clock interrupt handler,\nbecause hrtimers honors KVM's request for an expiration in the past and\nimmediately re-invokes KVM's callback after reprogramming.  And because\nthe interrupt handler runs with IRQs disabled, restarting KVM's hrtimer\nover and over until the target expiration is advanced to \"now\" can result\nin a hard lockup.\n\nE.g. the following hard lockup was triggered in the host when running a\nWindows VM (only relevant because it used the APIC timer in periodic mode)\nafter resuming the VM from a long suspend (in the host).\n\n  NMI watchdog: Watchdog detected hard LOCKUP on cpu 45\n  ...\n  RIP: 0010:advance_periodic_target_expiration+0x4d/0x80 [kvm]\n  ...\n  RSP: 0018:ff4f88f5d98d8ef0 EFLAGS: 00000046\n  RAX: fff0103f91be678e RBX: fff0103f91be678e RCX: 00843a7d9e127bcc\n  RDX: 0000000000000002 RSI: 0052ca4003697505 RDI: ff440d5bfbdbd500\n  RBP: ff440d5956f99200 R08: ff2ff2a42deb6a84 R09: 000000000002a6c0\n  R10: 0122d794016332b3 R11: 0000000000000000 R12: ff440db1af39cfc0\n  R13: ff440db1af39cfc0 R14: ffffffffc0d4a560 R15: ff440db1af39d0f8\n  FS:  00007f04a6ffd700(0000) GS:ff440db1af380000(0000) knlGS:000000e38a3b8000\n  CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n  CR2: 000000d5651feff8 CR3: 000000684e038002 CR4: 0000000000773ee0\n  PKRU: 55555554\n  Call Trace:\n   <IRQ>\n   apic_timer_fn+0x31/0x50 [kvm]\n   __hrtimer_run_queues+0x100/0x280\n   hrtimer_interrupt+0x100/0x210\n   ? ttwu_do_wakeup+0x19/0x160\n   smp_apic_timer_interrupt+0x6a/0x130\n   apic_timer_interrupt+0xf/0x20\n   </IRQ>\n\nMoreover, if the suspend duration of the virtual machine is not long enough\nto trigger a hard lockup in this scenario, since commit 98c25ead5eda\n(\"KVM: VMX: Move preemption timer <=> hrtimer dance to common x86\"), KVM\nwill continue using the software timer until the guest reprograms the APIC\ntimer in some way.

At the same\ntime, the code in ftrace assumes that no more than 2 instructions can\nbe generated, which is why it stores them in an int[2] array.

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: mac80211: Discard Beacon frames to non-broadcast address\n\nBeacon frames are required to be sent to the broadcast address, see IEEE\nStd 802.11-2020, 11.1.3.1 (\"The Address 1 field of the Beacon .. frame\nshall be set to the broadcast address\"). A unicast Beacon frame might be\nused as a targeted attack to get one of the associated STAs to do\nsomething (e.g., using CSA to move it to another channel). As such, it\nis better have strict filtering for this on the received side and\ndiscard all Beacon frames that are sent to an unexpected address.\n\nThis is even more important for cases where beacon protection is used.\nThe current implementation in mac80211 is correctly discarding unicast\nBeacon frames if the Protected Frame bit in the Frame Control field is\nset to 0. However, if that bit is set to 1, the logic used for checking\nfor configured BIGTK(s) does not actually work. If the driver does not\nhave logic for dropping unicast Beacon frames with Protected Frame bit\n1, these frames would be accepted in mac80211 processing as valid Beacon\nframes even though they are not protected. This would allow beacon\nprotection to be bypassed. While the logic for checking beacon\nprotection could be extended to cover this corner case, a more generic\ncheck for discard all Beacon frames based on A1=unicast address covers\nthis without needing additional changes.\n\nAddress all these issues by dropping received Beacon frames if they are\nsent to a non-broadcast address.",

In particular, this sets the eb->vma[i].vma pointers to\nNULL, simplifying cleanup and getting rid of the bug described below.\n\nDuring the execution of eb_lookup_vmas(), the eb->vma array is\nsuccessively filled up with struct eb_vma objects. This process includes\ncalling eb_add_vma(), which might fail; however, even in the event of\nfailure, eb->vma[i].vma is set for the currently processed buffer.\n\nIf eb_add_vma() fails, eb_lookup_vmas() returns with an error, which\nprompts a call to eb_release_vmas() to clean up the mess. Since\neb_lookup_vmas() might fail during processing any (possibly not first)\nbuffer, eb_release_vmas() checks whether a buffer's vma is NULL to know\nat what point did the lookup function fail.\n\nIn eb_lookup_vmas(), eb->vma[i].vma is set to NULL if either the helper\nfunction eb_lookup_vma() or eb_validate_vma() fails. eb->vma[i+1].vma is\nset to NULL in case i915_gem_object_userptr_submit_init() fails; the\ncurrent one needs to be cleaned up by eb_release_vmas() at this point,\nso the next one is set. If eb_add_vma() fails, neither the current nor\nthe next vma is set to NULL, which is a source of a NULL deref bug\ndescribed in the issue linked in the Closes tag.\n\nWhen entering eb_lookup_vmas(), the vma pointers are set to the slab\npoison value, instead of NULL. This doesn't matter for the actual\nlookup, since it gets overwritten anyway, however the eb_release_vmas()\nfunction only recognizes NULL as the stopping value, hence the pointers\nare being set to NULL as they go in case of intermediate failure. This\npatch changes the approach to filling them all with NULL at the start\ninstead, rather than handling that manually during failure.\n\n(cherry picked from commit 08889b706d4f0b8d2352b7ca29c2d8df4d0787cd)",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: dsa: properly keep track of conduit reference\n\nProblem description\n-------------------\n\nDSA has a mumbo-jumbo of reference handling of the conduit net device\nand its kobject which, sadly, is just wrong and doesn't make sense.\n\nThere are two distinct problems.\n\n1. The OF path, which uses of_find_net_device_by_node(), never releases\n   the elevated refcount on the conduit's kobject. Nominally, the OF and\n   non-OF paths should result in objects having identical reference\n   counts taken, and it is already suspicious that\n   dsa_dev_to_net_device() has a put_device() call which is missing in\n   dsa_port_parse_of(), but we can actually even verify that an issue\n   exists. With CONFIG_DEBUG_KOBJECT_RELEASE=y, if we run this command\n   \"before\" and \"after\" applying this patch:\n\n(unbind the conduit driver for net device eno2)\necho 0000:00:00.2 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/fsl_enetc/unbind\n\nwe see these lines in the output diff which appear only with the patch\napplied:\n\nkobject: 'eno2' (ffff002009a3a6b8): kobject_release, parent 0000000000000000 (delayed 1000)\nkobject: '109' (ffff0020099d59a0): kobject_release, parent 0000000000000000 (delayed 1000)\n\n2. After we find the conduit interface one way (OF) or another (non-OF),\n   it can get unregistered at any time, and DSA remains with a long-lived,\n   but in this case stale, cpu_dp->conduit pointer. Holding the net\n   device's underlying kobject isn't actually of much help, it just\n   prevents it from being freed (but we never need that kobject\n   directly). What helps us to prevent the net device from being\n   unregistered is the parallel netdev reference mechanism (dev_hold()\n   and dev_put()).\n\nActually we actually use that netdev tracker mechanism implicitly on\nuser ports since commit 2f1e8ea726e9 (\"net: dsa: link interfaces with\nthe DSA master to get rid of lockdep warnings\"), via netdev_upper_dev_link().\nBut time still passes at DSA switch probe time between the initial\nof_find_net_device_by_node() code and the user port creation time, time\nduring which the conduit could unregister itself and DSA wouldn't know\nabout it.\n\nSo we have to run of_find_net_device_by_node() under rtnl_lock() to\nprevent that from happening, and release the lock only with the netdev\ntracker having acquired the reference.\n\nDo we need to keep the reference until dsa_unregister_switch() /\ndsa_switch_shutdown()?\n1: Maybe yes. A switch device will still be registered even if all user\n   ports failed to probe, see commit 86f8b1c01a0a (\"net: dsa: Do not\n   make user port errors fatal\"), and the cpu_dp->conduit pointers\n   remain valid.  I haven't audited all call paths to see whether they\n   will actually use the conduit in lack of any user port, but if they\n   do, it seems safer to not rely on user ports for that reference.\n2. Definitely yes. We support changing the conduit which a user port is\n   associated to, and we can get into a situation where we've moved all\n   user ports away from a conduit, thus no longer hold any reference to\n   it via the net device tracker. But we shouldn't let it go nonetheless\n   - see the next change in relation to dsa_tree_find_first_conduit()\n   and LAG conduits which disappear.\n   We have to be prepared to return to the physical conduit, so the CPU\n   port must explicitly keep another reference to it. This is also to\n   say: the user ports and their CPU ports may not always keep a\n   reference to the same conduit net device, and both are needed.\n\nAs for the conduit's kobject for the /sys/class/net/ entry, we don't\ncare about it, we can release it as soon as we hold the net device\nobject itself.\n\nHistory and blame attribution\n-----------------------------\n\nThe code has been refactored so many times, it is very difficult to\nfollow and properly attribute a blame, but I'll try to make a short\nhistory which I hope to be correct.\n\nWe have two distinct probing paths:\n- one for OF, introduced in 2016 i\n---truncated---",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndmaengine: tegra-adma: Fix use-after-free\n\nA use-after-free bug exists in the Tegra ADMA driver when audio streams\nare terminated, particularly during XRUN conditions. The issue occurs\nwhen the DMA buffer is freed by tegra_adma_terminate_all() before the\nvchan completion tasklet finishes accessing it.\n\nThe race condition follows this sequence:\n\n  1. DMA transfer completes, triggering an interrupt that schedules the\n     completion tasklet (tasklet has not executed yet)\n  2. Audio playback stops, calling tegra_adma_terminate_all() which\n     frees the DMA buffer memory via kfree()\n  3. The scheduled tasklet finally executes, calling vchan_complete()\n     which attempts to access the already-freed memory\n\nSince tasklets can execute at any time after being scheduled, there is\nno guarantee that the buffer will remain valid when vchan_complete()\nruns.\n\nFix this by properly synchronizing the virtual channel completion:\n - Calling vchan_terminate_vdesc() in tegra_adma_stop() to mark the\n   descriptors as terminated instead of freeing the descriptor.\n - Add the callback tegra_adma_synchronize() that calls\n   vchan_synchronize() which kills any pending tasklets and frees any\n   terminated descriptors.\n\nCrash logs:\n[  337.427523] BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in vchan_complete+0x124/0x3b0\n[  337.427544] Read of size 8 at addr ffff000132055428 by task swapper/0/0\n\n[  337.427562] Call trace:\n[  337.427564]  dump_backtrace+0x0/0x320\n[  337.427571]  show_stack+0x20/0x30\n[  337.427575]  dump_stack_lvl+0x68/0x84\n[  337.427584]  print_address_description.constprop.0+0x74/0x2b8\n[  337.427590]  kasan_report+0x1f4/0x210\n[  337.427598]  __asan_load8+0xa0/0xd0\n[  337.427603]  vchan_complete+0x124/0x3b0\n[  337.427609]  tasklet_action_common.constprop.0+0x190/0x1d0\n[  337.427617]  tasklet_action+0x30/0x40\n[  337.427623]  __do_softirq+0x1a0/0x5c4\n[  337.427628]  irq_exit+0x110/0x140\n[  337.427633]  handle_domain_irq+0xa4/0xe0\n[  337.427640]  gic_handle_irq+0x64/0x160\n[  337.427644]  call_on_irq_stack+0x20/0x4c\n[  337.427649]  do_interrupt_handler+0x7c/0x90\n[  337.427654]  el1_interrupt+0x30/0x80\n[  337.427659]  el1h_64_irq_handler+0x18/0x30\n[  337.427663]  el1h_64_irq+0x7c/0x80\n[  337.427667]  cpuidle_enter_state+0xe4/0x540\n[  337.427674]  cpuidle_enter+0x54/0x80\n[  337.427679]  do_idle+0x2e0/0x380\n[  337.427685]  cpu_startup_entry+0x2c/0x70\n[  337.427690]  rest_init+0x114/0x130\n[  337.427695]  arch_call_rest_init+0x18/0x24\n[  337.427702]  start_kernel+0x380/0x3b4\n[  337.427706]  __primary_switched+0xc0/0xc8",

In some case that delete attempt fails when\nthe target inode is a directory that contains a subvolume inside it, since\nthe log replay code is not prepared to deal with directory entries that\npoint to root items (only inode items).\n\n1) We have directories \"dir1\" (inode A) and \"dir2\" (inode B) under the\n   same parent directory;\n\n2) We have a file (inode C) under directory \"dir1\" (inode A);\n\n3) We have a subvolume inside directory \"dir2\" (inode B);\n\n4) All these inodes were persisted in a past transaction and we are\n   currently at transaction N;\n\n5) We rename the file (inode C), so at btrfs_log_new_name() we update\n   inode C's last_unlink_trans to N;\n\n6) We get a rename exchange for \"dir1\" (inode A) and \"dir2\" (inode B),\n   so after the exchange \"dir1\" is inode B and \"dir2\" is inode A.\n   During the rename exchange we call btrfs_log_new_name() for inodes\n   A and B, but because they are directories, we don't update their\n   last_unlink_trans to N;\n\n7) An fsync against the file (inode C) is done, and because its inode\n   has a last_unlink_trans with a value of N we log its parent directory\n   (inode A) (through btrfs_log_all_parents(), called from\n   btrfs_log_inode_parent()).\n\n8) So we end up with inode B not logged, which now has the old name\n   of inode A. At copy_inode_items_to_log(), when logging inode A, we\n   did not check if we had any conflicting inode to log because inode\n   A has a generation lower than the current transaction (created in\n   a past transaction);\n\n9) After a power failure, when replaying the log tree, since we find that\n   inode A has a new name that conflicts with the name of inode B in the\n   fs tree, we attempt to delete inode B... this is wrong since that\n   directory was never deleted before the power failure, and because there\n   is a subvolume inside that directory, attempting to delete it will fail\n   since replay_dir_deletes() and btrfs_unlink_inode() are not prepared\n   to deal with dir items that point to roots instead of inodes.\n\n   When that happens the mount fails and we get a stack trace like the\n   following:\n\n   [87.2314] BTRFS info (device dm-0): start tree-log replay\n   [87.2318] BTRFS critical (device dm-0): failed to delete reference to subvol, root 5 inode 256 parent 259\n   [87.2332] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n   [87.2338] BTRFS: Transaction aborted (error -2)\n   [87.2346] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 638968 at fs/btrfs/inode.c:4345 __btrfs_unlink_inode+0x416/0x440 [btrfs]\n   [87.2368] Modules linked in: btrfs loop dm_thin_pool (...)\n   [87.2470] CPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 638968 Comm: mount Tainted: G        W           6.18.0-rc7-btrfs-next-218+ #2 PREEMPT(full)\n   [87.2489] Tainted: [W]=WARN\n   [87.2494] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.16.2-0-gea1b7a073390-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\n   [87.2514] RIP: 0010:__btrfs_unlink_inode+0x416/0x440 [btrfs]\n   [87.2538] Code: c0 89 04 24 (...)\n   [87.2568] RSP: 0018:ffffc0e741f4b9b8 EFLAGS: 00010286\n   [87.2574] RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffff9d3ec8a6cf60 RCX: 0000000000000000\n   [87.2582] RDX: 0000000000000002 RSI: ffffffff84ab45a1 RDI: 00000000ffffffff\n   [87.2591] RBP: ffff9d3ec8a6ef20 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: ffffc0e741f4b840\n   [87.2599] R10: ffff9d45dc1fffa8 R11: 0000000000000003 R12: ffff9d3ee26d77e0\n   [87.2608] R13: ffffc0e741f4ba98 R14: ffff9d4458040800 R15: ffff9d44b6b7ca10\n   [87.2618] FS:  00007f7b9603a840(0000) GS:ffff9d4658982000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n   [87.\n---truncated---",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: fix deadlock in wait_current_trans() due to ignored transaction type\n\nWhen wait_current_trans() is called during start_transaction(), it\ncurrently waits for a blocked transaction without considering whether\nthe given transaction type actually needs to wait for that particular\ntransaction state. The btrfs_blocked_trans_types[] array already defines\nwhich transaction types should wait for which transaction states, but\nthis check was missing in wait_current_trans().\n\nThis can lead to a deadlock scenario involving two transactions and\npending ordered extents:\n\n  1. Transaction A is in TRANS_STATE_COMMIT_DOING state\n\n  2. A worker processing an ordered extent calls start_transaction()\n     with TRANS_JOIN\n\n  3. join_transaction() returns -EBUSY because Transaction A is in\n     TRANS_STATE_COMMIT_DOING\n\n  4. Transaction A moves to TRANS_STATE_UNBLOCKED and completes\n\n  5. A new Transaction B is created (TRANS_STATE_RUNNING)\n\n  6. The ordered extent from step 2 is added to Transaction B's\n     pending ordered extents\n\n  7. Transaction B immediately starts commit by another task and\n     enters TRANS_STATE_COMMIT_START\n\n  8. The worker finally reaches wait_current_trans(), sees Transaction B\n     in TRANS_STATE_COMMIT_START (a blocked state), and waits\n     unconditionally\n\n  9. However, TRANS_JOIN should NOT wait for TRANS_STATE_COMMIT_START\n     according to btrfs_blocked_trans_types[]\n\n  10. Transaction B is waiting for pending ordered extents to complete\n\n  11. Deadlock: Transaction B waits for ordered extent, ordered extent\n      waits for Transaction B\n\nThis can be illustrated by the following call stacks:\n  CPU0                              CPU1\n                                    btrfs_finish_ordered_io()\n                                      start_transaction(TRANS_JOIN)\n                                        join_transaction()\n                                          # -EBUSY (Transaction A is\n                                          # TRANS_STATE_COMMIT_DOING)\n  # Transaction A completes\n  # Transaction B created\n  # ordered extent added to\n  # Transaction B's pending list\n  btrfs_commit_transaction()\n    # Transaction B enters\n    # TRANS_STATE_COMMIT_START\n    # waiting for pending ordered\n    # extents\n                                        wait_current_trans()\n                                          # waits for Transaction B\n                                          # (should not wait!)\n\nTask bstore_kv_sync in btrfs_commit_transaction waiting for ordered\nextents:\n\n  __schedule+0x2e7/0x8a0\n  schedule+0x64/0xe0\n  btrfs_commit_transaction+0xbf7/0xda0 [btrfs]\n  btrfs_sync_file+0x342/0x4d0 [btrfs]\n  __x64_sys_fdatasync+0x4b/0x80\n  do_syscall_64+0x33/0x40\n  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xa9\n\nTask kworker in wait_current_trans waiting for transaction commit:\n\n  Workqueue: btrfs-syno_nocow btrfs_work_helper [btrfs]\n  __schedule+0x2e7/0x8a0\n  schedule+0x64/0xe0\n  wait_current_trans+0xb0/0x110 [btrfs]\n  start_transaction+0x346/0x5b0 [btrfs]\n  btrfs_finish_ordered_io.isra.0+0x49b/0x9c0 [btrfs]\n  btrfs_work_helper+0xe8/0x350 [btrfs]\n  process_one_work+0x1d3/0x3c0\n  worker_thread+0x4d/0x3e0\n  kthread+0x12d/0x150\n  ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30\n\nFix this by passing the transaction type to wait_current_trans() and\nchecking btrfs_blocked_trans_types[cur_trans->state] against the given\ntype before deciding to wait. This ensures that transaction types which\nare allowed to join during certain blocked states will not unnecessarily\nwait and cause deadlocks.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: fix memory leak in skb_segment_list for GRO packets\n\nWhen skb_segment_list() is called during packet forwarding, it handles\npackets that were aggregated by the GRO engine.\n\nHistorically, the segmentation logic in skb_segment_list assumes that\nindividual segments are split from a parent SKB and may need to carry\ntheir own socket memory accounting. Accordingly, the code transfers\ntruesize from the parent to the newly created segments.\n\nPrior to commit ed4cccef64c1 (\"gro: fix ownership transfer\"), this\ntruesize subtraction in skb_segment_list() was valid because fragments\nstill carry a reference to the original socket.\n\nHowever, commit ed4cccef64c1 (\"gro: fix ownership transfer\") changed\nthis behavior by ensuring that fraglist entries are explicitly\norphaned (skb->sk = NULL) to prevent illegal orphaning later in the\nstack. This change meant that the entire socket memory charge remained\nwith the head SKB, but the corresponding accounting logic in\nskb_segment_list() was never updated.\n\nAs a result, the current code unconditionally adds each fragment's\ntruesize to delta_truesize and subtracts it from the parent SKB. Since\nthe fragments are no longer charged to the socket, this subtraction\nresults in an effective under-count of memory when the head is freed.\nThis causes sk_wmem_alloc to remain non-zero, preventing socket\ndestruction and leading to a persistent memory leak.\n\nThe leak can be observed via KMEMLEAK when tearing down the networking\nenvironment:\n\nunreferenced object 0xffff8881e6eb9100 (size 2048):\n  comm \"ping\", pid 6720, jiffies 4295492526\n  backtrace:\n    kmem_cache_alloc_noprof+0x5c6/0x800\n    sk_prot_alloc+0x5b/0x220\n    sk_alloc+0x35/0xa00\n    inet6_create.part.0+0x303/0x10d0\n    __sock_create+0x248/0x640\n    __sys_socket+0x11b/0x1d0\n\nSince skb_segment_list() is exclusively used for SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST\npackets constructed by GRO, the truesize adjustment is removed.\n\nThe call to skb_release_head_state() must be preserved. As documented in\ncommit cf673ed0e057 (\"net: fix fraglist segmentation reference count\nleak\"), it is still required to correctly drop references to SKB\nextensions that may be overwritten during __copy_skb_header().",

For this we\nadd a new flag protected with nn->client_lock.  It is set only while it\nis safe to make client tracking calls, and v4_end_grace only schedules\nwork while the flag is set with the spinlock held.\n\nSo this patch adds a nfsd_net field \"client_tracking_active\" which is\nset as described.  Another field \"grace_end_forced\", is set when\nv4_end_grace is written.  After this is set, and providing\nclient_tracking_active is set, the laundromat is scheduled.\nThis \"grace_end_forced\" field bypasses other checks for whether the\ngrace period has finished.\n\nThis resolves a race which can result in use-after-free.",

During a reset, the driver will de-allocate resources for the\nvport, and there is no guarantee that those will recover, which is why the\nexisting vport_ctrl_lock does not provide sufficient protection.\n\nidpf_detach_and_close() is called right before reset handling. If the\nreset handling succeeds, the netdevs state is recovered via call to\nidpf_attach_and_open(). If the reset handling fails the netdevs remain\ndown. The detach/down calls are protected with RTNL lock to avoid racing\nwith callbacks.

A retry to change\nprofile, e.g. another attempt to call mlx5e_netdev_change_profile via\nswitchdev mode change, will crash trying to access the now NULL\npriv->mdev.\n\nThis fix allows mlx5e_netdev_change_profile() to handle previous\nfailures and an empty priv, by not assuming priv is valid.\n\nPass netdev and mdev to all flows requiring\nmlx5e_netdev_change_profile() and avoid passing priv.\nIn mlx5e_netdev_change_profile() check if current priv is valid, and if\nnot, just attach the new profile without trying to access the old one.\n\nThis fixes the following oops, when enabling switchdev mode for the 2nd\ntime after first time failure:\n\n ## Enabling switchdev mode first time:\n\nmlx5_core 0012:03:00.1: E-Switch: Supported tc chains and prios offload\nworkqueue: Failed to create a rescuer kthread for wq \"mlx5e\": -EINTR\nmlx5_core 0012:03:00.1: mlx5e_netdev_init_profile:6214:(pid 37199): mlx5e_priv_init failed, err=-12\nmlx5_core 0012:03:00.1 gpu3rdma1: mlx5e_netdev_change_profile: new profile init failed, -12\nworkqueue: Failed to create a rescuer kthread for wq \"mlx5e\": -EINTR\nmlx5_core 0012:03:00.1: mlx5e_netdev_init_profile:6214:(pid 37199): mlx5e_priv_init failed, err=-12\nmlx5_core 0012:03:00.1 gpu3rdma1: mlx5e_netdev_change_profile: failed to rollback to orig profile, -12\n                                                                         ^^^^^^^^\nmlx5_core 0000:00:03.0: E-Switch: Disable: mode(LEGACY), nvfs(0), necvfs(0), active vports(0)\n\n ## retry: Enabling switchdev mode 2nd time:\n\nmlx5_core 0000:00:03.0: E-Switch: Supported tc chains and prios offload\nBUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000038\n #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page\nPGD 0 P4D 0\nOops: Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP NOPTI\nCPU: 13 UID: 0 PID: 520 Comm: devlink Not tainted 6.18.0-rc4+ #91 PREEMPT(voluntary)\nHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS 1.16.3-2.fc40 04/01/2014\nRIP: 0010:mlx5e_detach_netdev+0x3c/0x90\nCode: 50 00 00 f0 80 4f 78 02 48 8b bf e8 07 00 00 48 85 ff 74 16 48 8b 73 78 48 d1 ee 83 e6 01 83 f6 01 40 0f b6 f6 e8 c4 42 00 00 <48> 8b 45 38 48 85 c0 74 08 48 89 df e8 cc 47 40 1e 48 8b bb f0 07\nRSP: 0018:ffffc90000673890 EFLAGS: 00010246\nRAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffff8881036a89c0 RCX: 0000000000000000\nRDX: ffff888113f63800 RSI: ffffffff822fe720 RDI: 0000000000000000\nRBP: 0000000000000000 R08: 0000000000002dcd R09: 0000000000000000\nR10: ffffc900006738e8 R11: 00000000ffffffff R12: 0000000000000000\nR13: 0000000000000000 R14: ffff8881036a89c0 R15: 0000000000000000\nFS:  00007fdfb8384740(0000) GS:ffff88856a9d6000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\nCS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\nCR2: 0000000000000038 CR3: 0000000112ae0005 CR4: 0000000000370ef0\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n mlx5e_netdev_change_profile+0x45/0xb0\n mlx5e_vport_rep_load+0x27b/0x2d0\n mlx5_esw_offloads_rep_load+0x72/0xf0\n esw_offloads_enable+0x5d0/0x970\n mlx5_eswitch_enable_locked+0x349/0x430\n ? is_mp_supported+0x57/0xb0\n mlx5_devlink_eswitch_mode_set+0x26b/0x430\n devlink_nl_eswitch_set_doit+0x6f/0xf0\n genl_family_rcv_msg_doit+0xe8/0x140\n genl_rcv_msg+0x18b/0x290\n ? __pfx_devlink_nl_pre_doit+0x10/0x10\n ? __pfx_devlink_nl_eswitch_set_doit+0x10/0x10\n ? __pfx_devlink_nl_post_doit+0x10/0x10\n ? __pfx_genl_rcv_msg+0x10/0x10\n netlink_rcv_skb+0x52/0x100\n genl_rcv+0x28/0x40\n netlink_unicast+0x282/0x3e0\n ? __alloc_skb+0xd6/0x190\n netlink_sendmsg+0x1f7/0x430\n __sys_sendto+0x213/0x220\n ? __sys_recvmsg+0x6a/0xd0\n __x64_sys_sendto+0x24/0x30\n do_syscall_64+0x50/0x1f0\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e\nRIP: 0033:0x7fdfb8495047",

This simplifies the\nfaultable code path by using the standard kernel file reading interface\nwhich handles all the complexity of reading file data.\n\nAt the moment we are not changing the code for non-sleepable context which\nuses filemap_get_folio() and only succeeds if the target folios are\nalready in memory and up-to-date.  The reason is to keep the patch simple\nand easier to backport to stable kernels.\n\nSyzbot repro does not crash the kernel anymore and the selftests run\nsuccessfully.\n\nIn the follow up we will make __kernel_read() with IOCB_NOWAIT work for\nnon-sleepable contexts.  In addition, I would like to replace the\nsecretmem check with a more generic approach and will add fstest for the\nbuildid code.",

Per Intel's SDM,\nXSAVE saves XSTATE_BV as '0' for components that are disabled via XFD\n(and non-compacted XSAVE saves the initial configuration of the state\ncomponent):\n\n  If XSAVE, XSAVEC, XSAVEOPT, or XSAVES is saving the state component i,\n  the instruction does not generate #NM when XCR0[i] = IA32_XFD[i] = 1;\n  instead, it operates as if XINUSE[i] = 0 (and the state component was\n  in its initial state): it saves bit i of XSTATE_BV field of the XSAVE\n  header as 0; in addition, XSAVE saves the initial configuration of the\n  state component (the other instructions do not save state component i).\n\nAlternatively, KVM could always do XRSTOR with XFD=0, e.g. by using\na constant XFD based on the set of enabled features when XSAVEing for\na struct fpu_guest.  However, having XSTATE_BV[i]=1 for XFD-disabled\nfeatures can only happen in the above interrupt case, or in similar\nscenarios involving preemption on preemptible kernels, because\nfpu_swap_kvm_fpstate()'s call to save_fpregs_to_fpstate() saves the\noutgoing FPU state with the current XFD; and that is (on all but the\nfirst WRMSR to XFD) the guest XFD.\n\nTherefore, XFD can only go out of sync with XSTATE_BV in the above\ninterrupt case, or in similar scenarios involving preemption on\npreemptible kernels, and it we can consider it (de facto) part of KVM\nABI that KVM_GET_XSAVE returns XSTATE_BV[i]=0 for XFD-disabled features.\n\n[Move clea\n---truncated---",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nALSA: scarlett2: Fix buffer overflow in config retrieval\n\nThe scarlett2_usb_get_config() function has a logic error in the\nendianness conversion code that can cause buffer overflows when\ncount > 1.\n\nThe code checks `if (size == 2)` where `size` is the total buffer size in\nbytes, then loops `count` times treating each element as u16 (2 bytes).\nThis causes the loop to access `count * 2` bytes when the buffer only\nhas `size` bytes allocated.\n\nFix by checking the element size (config_item->size) instead of the\ntotal buffer size. This ensures the endianness conversion matches the\nactual element type.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvsock/virtio: cap TX credit to local buffer size\n\nThe virtio transports derives its TX credit directly from peer_buf_alloc,\nwhich is set from the remote endpoint's SO_VM_SOCKETS_BUFFER_SIZE value.\n\nOn the host side this means that the amount of data we are willing to\nqueue for a connection is scaled by a guest-chosen buffer size, rather\nthan the host's own vsock configuration. A malicious guest can advertise\na large buffer and read slowly, causing the host to allocate a\ncorrespondingly large amount of sk_buff memory.\nThe same thing would happen in the guest with a malicious host, since\nvirtio transports share the same code base.\n\nIntroduce a small helper, virtio_transport_tx_buf_size(), that\nreturns min(peer_buf_alloc, buf_alloc), and use it wherever we consume\npeer_buf_alloc.\n\nThis ensures the effective TX window is bounded by both the peer's\nadvertised buffer and our own buf_alloc (already clamped to\nbuffer_max_size via SO_VM_SOCKETS_BUFFER_MAX_SIZE), so a remote peer\ncannot force the other to queue more data than allowed by its own\nvsock settings.\n\nOn an unpatched Ubuntu 22.04 host (~64 GiB RAM), running a PoC with\n32 guest vsock connections advertising 2 GiB each and reading slowly\ndrove Slab/SUnreclaim from ~0.5 GiB to ~57 GiB; the system only\nrecovered after killing the QEMU process. That said, if QEMU memory is\nlimited with cgroups, the maximum memory used will be limited.\n\nWith this patch applied:\n\n  Before:\n    MemFree:        ~61.6 GiB\n    Slab:           ~142 MiB\n    SUnreclaim:     ~117 MiB\n\n  After 32 high-credit connections:\n    MemFree:        ~61.5 GiB\n    Slab:           ~178 MiB\n    SUnreclaim:     ~152 MiB\n\nOnly ~35 MiB increase in Slab/SUnreclaim, no host OOM, and the guest\nremains responsive.\n\nCompatibility with non-virtio transports:\n\n  - VMCI uses the AF_VSOCK buffer knobs to size its queue pairs per\n    socket based on the local vsk->buffer_* values; the remote side\n    cannot enlarge those queues beyond what the local endpoint\n    configured.\n\n  - Hyper-V's vsock transport uses fixed-size VMBus ring buffers and\n    an MTU bound; there is no peer-controlled credit field comparable\n    to peer_buf_alloc, and the remote endpoint cannot drive in-flight\n    kernel memory above those ring sizes.\n\n  - The loopback path reuses virtio_transport_common.c, so it\n    naturally follows the same semantics as the virtio transport.\n\nThis change is limited to virtio_transport_common.c and thus affects\nvirtio-vsock, vhost-vsock, and loopback, bringing them in line with the\n\"remote window intersected with local policy\" behaviour that VMCI and\nHyper-V already effectively have.\n\n[Stefano: small adjustments after changing the previous patch]\n[Stefano: tweak the commit message]",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64/fpsimd: signal: Fix restoration of SVE context\n\nWhen SME is supported, Restoring SVE signal context can go wrong in a\nfew ways, including placing the task into an invalid state where the\nkernel may read from out-of-bounds memory (and may potentially take a\nfatal fault) and/or may kill the task with a SIGKILL.\n\n(1) Restoring a context with SVE_SIG_FLAG_SM set can place the task into\n    an invalid state where SVCR.SM is set (and sve_state is non-NULL)\n    but TIF_SME is clear, consequently resuting in out-of-bounds memory\n    reads and/or killing the task with SIGKILL.\n\n    This can only occur in unusual (but legitimate) cases where the SVE\n    signal context has either been modified by userspace or was saved in\n    the context of another task (e.g. as with CRIU), as otherwise the\n    presence of an SVE signal context with SVE_SIG_FLAG_SM implies that\n    TIF_SME is already set.\n\n    While in this state, task_fpsimd_load() will NOT configure SMCR_ELx\n    (leaving some arbitrary value configured in hardware) before\n    restoring SVCR and attempting to restore the streaming mode SVE\n    registers from memory via sve_load_state(). As the value of\n    SMCR_ELx.LEN may be larger than the task's streaming SVE vector\n    length, this may read memory outside of the task's allocated\n    sve_state, reading unrelated data and/or triggering a fault.\n\n    While this can result in secrets being loaded into streaming SVE\n    registers, these values are never exposed. As TIF_SME is clear,\n    fpsimd_bind_task_to_cpu() will configure CPACR_ELx.SMEN to trap EL0\n    accesses to streaming mode SVE registers, so these cannot be\n    accessed directly at EL0. As fpsimd_save_user_state() verifies the\n    live vector length before saving (S)SVE state to memory, no secret\n    values can be saved back to memory (and hence cannot be observed via\n    ptrace, signals, etc).\n\n    When the live vector length doesn't match the expected vector length\n    for the task, fpsimd_save_user_state() will send a fatal SIGKILL\n    signal to the task. Hence the task may be killed after executing\n    userspace for some period of time.\n\n(2) Restoring a context with SVE_SIG_FLAG_SM clear does not clear the\n    task's SVCR.SM. If SVCR.SM was set prior to restoring the context,\n    then the task will be left in streaming mode unexpectedly, and some\n    register state will be combined inconsistently, though the task will\n    be left in legitimate state from the kernel's PoV.\n\n    This can only occur in unusual (but legitimate) cases where ptrace\n    has been used to set SVCR.SM after entry to the sigreturn syscall,\n    as syscall entry clears SVCR.SM.\n\n    In these cases, the the provided SVE register data will be loaded\n    into the task's sve_state using the non-streaming SVE vector length\n    and the FPSIMD registers will be merged into this using the\n    streaming SVE vector length.\n\nFix (1) by setting TIF_SME when setting SVCR.SM. This also requires\nensuring that the task's sme_state has been allocated, but as this could\ncontain live ZA state, it should not be zeroed. Fix (2) by clearing\nSVCR.SM when restoring a SVE signal context with SVE_SIG_FLAG_SM clear.\n\nFor consistency, I've pulled the manipulation of SVCR, TIF_SVE, TIF_SME,\nand fp_type earlier, immediately after the allocation of\nsve_state/sme_state, before the restore of the actual register state.\nThis makes it easier to ensure that these are always modified\nconsistently, even if a fault is taken while reading the register data\nfrom the signal context. I do not expect any software to depend on the\nexact state restored when a fault is taken while reading the context.",

These race conditions can\ncause the SCSI layer to fail to wake the error handler, leaving I/O\nthrough the SCSI host stuck as the error state cannot advance.\n\nFirst, there is an memory ordering issue within scsi_dec_host_busy().\nThe write which clears SCMD_STATE_INFLIGHT may be reordered with reads\ncounting in scsi_host_busy(). While the local CPU will see its own\nwrite, reordering can allow other CPUs in scsi_dec_host_busy() or\nscsi_eh_inc_host_failed() to see a raised busy count, causing no CPU to\nsee a host busy equal to the host_failed count.\n\nThis race condition can be prevented with a memory barrier on the error\npath to force the write to be visible before counting host busy\ncommands.\n\nSecond, there is a general ordering issue with scsi_eh_inc_host_failed(). By\ncounting busy commands before incrementing host_failed, it can race with a\nfinal command in scsi_dec_host_busy(), such that scsi_dec_host_busy() does\nnot see host_failed incremented but scsi_eh_inc_host_failed() counts busy\ncommands before SCMD_STATE_INFLIGHT is cleared by scsi_dec_host_busy(),\nresulting in neither waking the error handler task.\n\nThis needs the call to scsi_host_busy() to be moved after host_failed is\nincremented to close the race condition.",
